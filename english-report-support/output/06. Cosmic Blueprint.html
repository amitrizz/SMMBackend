<p><strong>The Laws of GOD</strong></p><p>Nilkanth Kesari introduces a compelling framework describing seven universal laws that govern all existence. Termed the <em>Laws of GOD, </em>where GOD stands for <em>Generator, Organizer, and Destroyer, </em>these laws are eternal, unalterable, and applicable to everything in the cosmos, from subatomic particles to galaxies.</p><ol><li><strong>Law of Dynamism</strong>: All entities are in constant motion, driven by time and intensity. Time ensures continuity, while intensity—expressed as <em>Supreme Metaphysical (Shiva) Power</em> and <em>Supreme Alchemical (Shakti) Power that </em>fuels transformation and balance.</li><li><strong>Law of Soul</strong>: Unlike all particles possessing energy, only living beings carry a soul, an <em>Encoded Electrical Energy is </em>instilled during formation. This soul grants consciousness, purpose, and evolution.</li><li><strong>Law of Constitution</strong>: Every entity has a unique composition formed by uniting elemental energies. This <em>Law of Oneness</em> affirms the interconnectedness of all existence, uniting the micro (Peenda) and macro (Bramhanda).</li><li><strong>Law of Span</strong>: Each element or life form has a defined lifespan determined by time, mass, and weight. This law underscores the finite nature of all existence within a cosmic schedule.</li><li><strong>Law of Creation</strong>: Nature constantly innovates, creating self-replicating life forms. Divine creations inherently possess the ability to reproduce, unlike artificial human creations.</li><li><strong>Law of Balance</strong>: The universe maintains harmony through dualities of light and dark, life and death. This balance prevents domination of any single force and sustains universal equilibrium.</li><li><strong>Law of Unification Change</strong>: Change is continuous and inevitable. Upon completion of their span, all entities dissolve back into the universe, reinforcing the cycle of unification and transformation.</li></ol><p>Of the 95 cosmic laws, <strong>23 directly affect human destiny</strong>, mirroring the 23 chromosome pairs inherited from each parent. These laws influence health, success, relationships, and spiritual growth. By aligning with them, individuals can fulfill their life’s purpose and avoid paths of destruction.</p><p>In essence, these divine laws reflect the inherent intelligence of the universe, guiding all existence toward harmony, evolution, and fulfillment.</p>
