<p>In the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira once asked Bhishma about the relationship between Exertion (human effort) and Destiny (divine will). In response, Bhishma shared a profound dialogue between Sage Vasishtha and Brahma, the Creator, offering timeless wisdom on lifeâ€™s fundamental forces.</p><p>Brahma likened life to a cultivated field: effort is the seed, and destiny is the environment. A farmer may till the soil, but without sowing seeds, no crop will grow. Similarly, destiny alone cannot bear fruit without the exertion of the individual. Good deeds, like quality seeds, lead to a bountiful harvest, while idleness brings stagnation and suffering.</p><p>Even celestial beings like gods, the Sun, Moon, and others, attained their divine status through virtuous actions and relentless effort as humans. Their elevation was not mere fate but a result of dedicated exertion. This highlights that personal effort is the true driver of progress, not passive reliance on destiny.</p><p>Brahma emphasized that wealth, friendship, happiness, and security arise from consistent action. Those who avoid effort and lean solely on destiny fall from the path, much like a wound worsened by harmful substances. Destiny, while present, is powerless without human participation.</p><p>Building on this ancient understanding, Nilkanth Kesari introduced the concept of the 108 karma factors, positive and negative influences that shape every area of life: health, wealth, education, peace, and more. By consciously enhancing positive karmas - like discipline, honesty, and service, and avoiding negative ones - like laziness and deception, it helps one crafts a life of purpose and prosperity.</p><p>True mastery in life stems from exertion. Destiny may offer potential, but only action transforms it into reality. Whether striving for spiritual growth, success, or inner peace, exertion remains the essential ingredient.</p><p>This wisdom invites us to take full responsibility for our choices, cultivating our lives as one would a sacred field, with care, effort, and awareness. In doing so, we honor both our divine nature and human capacity, shaping a life of meaning, abundance, and legacy.</p>
